# Book-Search-Engine-with-GraphQL

## Description
This is a Book Search Engine refactored to use GraphQL API instead of RESTful API. The overall funcitonality should remain largely identical to the client, but the server-side, backend functions should implement GraphQL.

## Installation
Download this repository onto your machine. In Git Bash, or inside VSC's integrated terminal, within this project's root directory. Run the command "npm run install" then "npm run build." Next, run the command "npm run develop" to run the actual project on a local server.

## Usage
The user can use this project to search and save books using data from the Google API. Users can do this by logging into an account first then using the search engine to find a book they want. User can create an account to do so if they do not have an existing account inside the database.
